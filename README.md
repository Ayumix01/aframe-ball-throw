Playable with **HTC Vive**.

This repository contains a small demonstration of A-Frame with vive controllers and physics powered by [A-Frame Extras](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras) and [A-Frame Physics System](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system). Grab a ball and chuck it at the stack of boxes!

### Expansion and Experimentation

Try forking this component and messing around with it. For instance, 

Change the force of gravity from 1.6 m/s^2 (similar to the Moon), to 9.8 m/s^2 (similar to the Earth).

```html
    <a-scene physics='gravity: -9.8' antialias='true'>
```

### Running locally

```bash
npm start
```
